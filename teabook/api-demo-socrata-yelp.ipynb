    "## What is an API?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Socrata API follows the REST (REpresentational State Transfer) design pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. It originally had a more abstract meaning, but has come to be a shorthand name for web sites that act a bit like python functions, taking as inputs values for certain parameters and producing outputs in the form of a long text string.\n",
    "\n",
    "API stands for Application Programming Interface. An API specifies how an external program (an application program) can request that a program perform certain computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting the two together, a REST API specifies how external programs can make HTTP requests to a web site in order to request that some computation be carried out and data returned as output. When a website is designed to accept requests generated by other computer programs, and produce outputs to be consumed by other programs, it is sometimes called a web service, as opposed to a web site which produces output meant for humans to consume in a web browser."

    "For this demonstration we will be making requests to the Socrata API with the The [NYC Dog License Dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/NYC-Dog-Licensing-Dataset/nu7n-tubp).\n",
    "\n",
    "Components of the url:\n",
    "- headers (required sometimes, but not always)\n",
    "- endpoints\n",
    "- parameters\n",
    "- API key\n",
    "\n",
    "In a REST API, the client or application program makes an HTTP request that includes information about what kind of request it is making. Web sites are free to define whatever format they want for how the request should be formatted. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this format, the URL has a standard structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the base URL: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/nu7n-tubp.json\n",
    "- a ? character\n",
    "- or more key-value pairs (parameters), formatted as key=value pairs and separated by the & character\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the following url requests to the NYC Dog License Dataset with the Socrata API:\n",
    "- https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/nu7n-tubp.json?rownumber=40895\n",
    "- https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/nu7n-tubp.json?licenseissueddate=2014-09-12T00:00:00.000\n",
    "- https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/nu7n-tubp.json?animalname=PAIGE&zipcode=10035\n",
    "\n",
    "Try copying that URL into a browser, or just clicking on it. Depending on your browser, it may put the contents into a file attachment that you have to open up to see the contents, or it may just show the contents in a browser window."

    "## Application Tokens and API Keys\n",
    "The Socrata Open Data API has two concepts around API access: authentication and application tokens. You only need to authenticate if you wish to add, delete, or modify data that is attached to your account, or if you wish to read data you own that you have marked as private. Read-only requests only require the application token. See the [SODA Producer API documentation](http://dev.socrata.com/publishers/soda-producer/soda-producer-basics.html) for more details on changing data. See the [API docs](https://dev.socrata.com/docs/app-tokens.html) for more information on app tokens and API keys. For this example we are requesting data from the API for analysis, so only the application token is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Socrata Open Data API uses application tokens for two purposes:\n",
    "- Using an application token allows the API to throttle by application, rather than via IP address, which gives you a higher throttling limit\n",
    "- Authentication using OAuth (OAuth 2.0 is the preferred option for cases where you are building a web or mobile application that needs to perform actions on behalf of the user, like accessing data, and the interaction model allows you to present the user with a form to obtain their permission for the app to do so.)\n",
    "\n",
    "See [Generating App Tokens and API Keys](https://support.socrata.com/hc/en-us/articles/210138558-Generating-an-App-Token) for instructions on generating your own app token.  "

    "We are using the Python sodapy library to make our request. The client sends our request for the data, and the API sends the data to us in .json format. Then the pandas library is used to format the results into a dataframe. The get() method is used with parameters to filter the data in our request. Check out the [SoSQL examples](https://github.com/xmunoz/sodapy/blob/master/examples/soql_queries.ipynb) in the sodapy github for more info.  The filters use the [SoSQL statements](https://dev.socrata.com/docs/queries/), which are based on SQL and have similar syntax."
